Title your PR in the following format:
<Jira ticket number>: <short description>

Example:
ADMIN-1822: update navbar height to match portal

This is important to ensure the Jira ticket is kept in sync with automated processes
that are parsing the ticket number with regular expressions

Multiple ticket numbers also work:
ADMIN-1822, PORTAL-1343: unpdate nav bar heights in admin and portal
-->
